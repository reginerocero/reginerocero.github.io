            10 (Simple) Good Study Habits <img src="assets/images/thumbsup.png">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          1. Get Organized. 
          <br>
          Between homework, tests, and extracurricular activities, it’s all too easy for things to slip through the cracks. A planner can help your child keep everything organized. Students should write down assignments, appointments and to-do lists, then review items in the planner at both the beginning and end of the day to stay on track.
          <br><br>
          2. Know the Expectations. 
          <br>
          Students shouldn’t have any surprises when it comes to how and what they will be graded on. By middle school and high school, most teachers will provide a course outline or syllabus, which can serve as a guide for the semester. If expectations aren’t clear, don’t wait until a bad report card comes in the mail. Your student should feel comfortable approaching teachers with questions about grading and assignments at any time. If this is not the case, it may be time for you as a parent to step in.
          <br><br>
          3. Designate a Study Area.
          <br>
          Yes, studying at the local coffee shop may seem like a good idea, but not if there are constantly people interrupting or other disruptions. Even at home, studying in front of the TV won’t be the best use of your son or daughter’s time. Help your child by providing a quiet, well-lit, low-traffic space for study time. Take it one step further and institute a “communications blackout” policy with no cell phones or social media allowed until schoolwork is done.
          <br><br>
          4. Develop a Study Plan.
          <br>
           First things first: students need to know when a test will take place, the types of questions that will be included and the topics that will be covered. From there, your student should create a study plan and allow ample time to prepare – there’s nothing worse than cramming the night before an exam. You can help by buying a wall calendar and asking him or her to assign topics and tasks for each day leading up to a due date or exam. Setting goals for each session is also key to success. If your child needs some help developing a study plan, our study skills program is a great resource! Our tutors will work with your child to develop an individualized plan that fits his or her needs, while instilling effective time management tips and organizational skills.
           <br><br>
          5. Think Positively.
          <br>
            Being in the right mindset can make all the difference. Encourage your child to think positively when studying or heading into an exam and by all means, avoid catastrophic thinking. Help your student turn negative statements like, “I’ll never have enough time to get a good grade on this exam,” into positive ones like, “I began preparing later than I should have but I put together a comprehensive study plan and will be able to get through the material prior to the exam.”
            <br><br>
          6. Create a Study Group.
          <br>
             Working in groups can help students when they’re struggling to understand a concept and can enable them to complete assignments more quickly than when working alone. Keep groups small and structured to ensure the maximum benefit to participants and reduce distractions.
            <br><br>
          7. Practice Active Listening.
          <br>
             It’s important for students to concentrate and avoid distractions when an instructor is presenting. Some tips to share with your child include: try concentrating on the main points being made, think about what the speaker is saying and pay attention to how things are said (gestures, tone of voice, etc.). They should avoid talking or thinking about problems when listening. If a teacher says, “This is important” or “I’ll write this on the board,” there’s a good chance students will see the concept on an exam.
            <br><br>
          8. Review Test-Taking Strategies.
          <br>
             It is normal for your son or daughter to feel stressed when taking an exam. However, there are certain strategies that will help him or her manage the stress and do his or her best on the exam. First, make sure that your child arrives on time and tries to stay relaxed. Students should be sure to read all of the directions on the exam and pace themselves so as not to feel rushed. You can let your child know that it’s OK to skip around on a test, if allowed, as he or she may be more comfortable with certain topics than others.
            <br><br>
          9. Read Actively.
          <br>
             It’s all too easy for students to skim over an assigned book chapter and not know the main points of what they just read. Help your student to practice active reading by asking him or her to note the main idea of each passage and look up unfamiliar words or concepts. Make an outline of the chapter or create flow charts and diagrams that help map out the concept at hand. After each section, have students write a summary in their own words and come up with possible exam questions.
                <br><br>
          10. Look to the Future.
          <br>
             For some students, college may seem like an intangible event in the very distant future, but in reality, it isn’t so far off. Starting early can be an immense help in navigating the college admissions process. Be sure to get organized, set goals with your child and have regular check-ins to assess progress.

            10 (Difficult) Bad Study Habits <img src="assets/images/thumbsdown.png">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          1. Starting a study session without a plan.
          <br>
          How to fix it: Before you start studying, create a study plan that outlines what you should accomplish in this session. Set a goal for each study session, such as which concepts you should be able to explain, or how many pages of an assignment you will write
          <br><br>
          2. Waiting until the last minute to start an assignment.
          <br>
          How to fix it: Write down when all assignments are due, and plan when you will work on each. Start assignments at least a week before they are due, and work on completing them little by little. This will help make them less overwhelming, too.
          <br><br>
          3. Spending hours studying, but not getting anything done.
          <br>
          How to fix it: Learn which part of the day you are most productive durings and do most studying then. For some students, the morning hours are when they are sharpest and ready to learn. For others, studying at night is when they work best.
          <br><br>
          4. Being distracted by social media and cell phones
          <br>
           How to fix it: Turn off the cell phone and sign out of social media accounts. Save checking in on Facebook or sending that text to a friend for a study break—or even better, when you have finished studying for the day.
           <br><br>
          5. Studying in front of the television
          <br>
            How to fix it: Choose a low-traffic spot in your home where you can study away from distractions. Make this a spot that is specifically used for studying. This will encourage you to get down to work quickly. Avoid your bedroom if possible—this space should be saved for relaxing and sleeping!
            <br><br>
          6. Trying to cram for tests the night before
          <br>
             How to fix it: Start studying early and study a little bit each night. Reviewing the material over a longer period of time will help you remember information better, and help identify any areas that need some extra review time.
            <br><br>
          7. Not asking the teacher for help when you don’t understand.
          <br>
             How to fix it: Each night, spend a couple minutes reviewing and reflecting on what you learned in class that day. Make notes on anything youe didn’t understand that you can take to the teacher for extra help.
            <br><br>
          8. Studying to remember, instead of studying to understand.
          <br>
             How to fix it: Instead of just memorizing material for a test, encourage yourself to connect it to other things you have learned. Make a mind map you can use to relate information and develop a deeper understanding of the material.
            <br><br>
          9. Never using an agenda.
          <br>
             How to fix it: Set a goal for yourself to use for your agenda every day for a month. Write down the dates of projects, tests, and homework assignments. Once you get in the habit of writing everything down in your agenda, you will find it easier to remember and plan to complete assignments on time.
                <br><br>
          10. Keeping disorganized notes.
          <br>
            How to fix it: First, organize notes from each subject into their own folder. Then, start practicing how to take more effective notes. Try out different note taking methods, and choose one that works best for him or her.
