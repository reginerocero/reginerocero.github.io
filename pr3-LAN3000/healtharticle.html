        <p>Question: A large part of being able to create is feeling healthy, which can be hard given stress and anxiety, a lack of healthcare options, and any other number of things that can make it hard to focus. How do you balance being creatively productive with maintaining a healthy mind/body?</p>

        <p>I haven’t found a real balance yet. I’ve just figured out how to keep my body and mind from fully breaking down, and the creative productivity can come or not come—but I don’t have the capacity to worry about that.</p>

        <p>I don’t think real balance is possible as long as you’re in a fundamentally unbalanced place, like the music industry. A lot of trying to stay healthy is learning to say no. I schedule regular short breaks between tours or between shows so I can go to the doctor, pick up my prescriptions, or just eat a real meal and get a full night’s sleep. I keep these short maintenance breaks no matter what, and I turn down a lot of gigs for them. I don’t drink alcohol on tour, and I go straight to sleep as soon as I can after shows. I also have a workout regimen that can be done without equipment in a small space in about 20-30 minutes, so I can work out in a corner of the venue after soundcheck, where I won’t bother anyone. I used to get very ill or just collapse on tour, and realized I wouldn’t be able to keep doing this if I wasn’t physically strong. I’m only able to do this type of work because I’m able-bodied—I can’t imagine how prohibitive being on tour would be if I was disabled in any way.</p>

        <p>When I’m on tour, I keep a water bottle, a thermos, and lot of pre-packaged non-expiring food with me because I don’t know when or what I’ll be able to eat next. I only do press or promo when I have something to promote, otherwise I say no. As an artist, you’re given the impression that every opportunity is the last and only and best opportunity you’ll ever get, and there’s a lot of pressure to say yes to whatever opportunities or working conditions are thrust upon you. You have to keep reminding yourself that there will be other opportunities, and that no matter how shiny or fleeting the chance in front of you looks, if you’re sick or burned out then you won’t be able to follow through on new opportunities anyway.</p>

        <p>And lastly, something I’ve been working on is staying in close touch with my support system. I don’t think I would have survived this long if I hadn’t been able to text or call my musician friends on a regular basis.</p>

        <p>I think about getting to a place where I’m not thinking about my mind/body 80% of my day. The ideal is to just be. I rarely get there, but choices matter for sure. Whether it’s eating something that’s not going to give me brain fog or trying to find an hour at any time to go to yoga, or taking supplements... I’m a freak about health. I do all of it, which tends to stress me out! The main thing I’ve learned, though, is that yes—it’s good to know what’s going to negatively affect your body so you can always move towards freedom by making good choices. But, it’s also important to take as much time as you need. I will sit for a whole day or longer listening to isochronic tones to clear my head when I’m working on a new piece. I think that the anxiety of time is often what leads me to feeling unhealthy, or to making poor decisions. But time is not something we can avoid, so grappling with it can be difficult. Learning to take time to do what I know helps me, as well as taking time to explore and discover in general, has helped me have a healthier mind/body.</p>

        <p>Maintaining a healthy mind/body is a very tricky balance to strike, and I don’t always succeed. Lately the things that have helped me the most are knowing when to say no, knowing my limitations, and understanding that creativity is not a race. Quality > quantity. When you are maxed out emotionally, psychologically, and physically, you won’t be able to operate at full steam, and will therefore be less likely to deliver in ways that represent what you are truly capable of.</p>

        <p>Another thing is knowing your innate worth as a human being first, and then as an artist. You must believe that what you have to offer matters no matter how outside influences and voices attempt to diminish that. I think a lot of artists struggle with feeling inadequate, largely because of capitalistic structures that tell us we don’t matter unless we are turning a profit. For musicians nowadays that means touring all the time, releasing a constant stream of music, making endless vapid social media posts for the sake of “branding” (barf), and so on and so forth. For many musicians, the resources to achieve that intense level of operation and “content” (double barf) are impossible to come by. So it’s a chicken and egg kind of thing, which can be maddening.</p>

        <p>Overall, the process and the work itself are what matter most, not whatever attention, validation, money, or followers may or may not come from it all. Trusting in that is hard, but necessary. Meditating on all of these things keeps me in check mentally. Physically, the most important thing for me is to sleep and to avoid excessive drinking, partying, etc. Everything is connected, and physical wear and tear affects your mental state as well. Every day brings another opportunity for an idea to blossom, or a skill to be honed. Don't trash your body. Don’t burn out. Don’t die. Take baths. Go for walks. Spend time with loved ones. Find affordable therapy if you can.</p>
